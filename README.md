Set the envirnoment variable 
Username 
Password
database name 

I used the ORM tool for db but we can write the custom sql query.
First register the user with uername, email and password. Save the register user with defined role like admin, regular user.
Admin user can perform all the operation like create the tasks and upadate the task where normal user can get the all list of tasks and particualer task by id.authenciation
we will store access token in local storage and send with each request for the authenication.
